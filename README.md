# tfmonopoles
Proof-of-concept for computing monopole and sphaleron field configurations using TensorFlow

## Generate a Magnetic Monopole
The script ```generateSingleMonopole.py``` runs a stochastic gradient descent optimisation, minimising the energy of lattice Georgi-Glashow SU(2) Theory with twisted boundary conditions. The minimum-energy field configuration for these boundary conditions is a magnetic monopole of charge +-1.
